## Example Usage

### API Examples

```bash
# Basic query execution
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cypher \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "MATCH (m:Method) WHERE m.visibility = '\''PUBLIC'\'' RETURN m LIMIT 10",
    "options": {
      "timeout": 30,
      "includeStats": true
    }
  }'

# Parameterized query
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cypher \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "MATCH (m:Method) WHERE m.visibility = $visibility RETURN m LIMIT $limit",
    "parameters": {
      "visibility": "PUBLIC",
      "limit": 5
    },
    "options": {
      "timeout": 30
    }
  }'
```

### Query Examples

```cypher
// Find all public methods
MATCH (m:Method)
WHERE m.visibility = 'PUBLIC'
RETURN m.name, m.class_name, m.file_path
LIMIT 10

// Find classes by package
MATCH (c:Class)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(p:Package)
WHERE p.name CONTAINS $packageName
RETURN c.name, p.name
ORDER BY c.name

// Count methods by visibility
MATCH (m:Method)
RETURN m.visibility, count(*) as methodCount
ORDER BY methodCount DESC
```

### Expected Output

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "query": "MATCH (m:Method) WHERE m.visibility = 'PUBLIC' RETURN m LIMIT 10",
