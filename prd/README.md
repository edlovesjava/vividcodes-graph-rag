- **Quality & Testing** - Code quality, testing, and production readiness

## üîÑ Story Lifecycle & Maintenance

### When Starting Work on a Story

1. **Check STORY_INDEX.md** for current status and dependencies
2. **Update status** from `NOT_STARTED` to `IN_PROGRESS`
3. **Read the full story document** for requirements and acceptance criteria
4. **Check dependencies** are met before starting

### During Development

1. **Follow the story template structure** for consistency
2. **Update implementation progress** in story files as needed
3. **Keep status current** - if blocked, update to `BLOCKED` with reason

### When Completing a Story

1. **‚úÖ CRITICAL**: Update **[STORY_INDEX.md](./STORY_INDEX.md)** immediately:

   - Change status from `IN_PROGRESS` to `COMPLETED`
   - Move story from "In Progress" to "Completed Stories" section if needed
   - Update Epic Mapping section status indicators (üìã ‚Üí ‚úÖ)
   - Update Template Conversion Status if applicable

2. **Update the story document**:

   - Mark all acceptance criteria as completed
   - Add completion summary/notes
   - Update status field in story metadata

3. **Update dependencies**:
   - Check if completing this story unblocks other stories
   - Update blocked stories' dependency status

### Creating New Stories

1. **Use STORY_TEMPLATE.md** as the base
2. **Assign next available story number** (check STORY_INDEX.md for highest number)
3. **Follow naming convention**: `STORY_[NUMBER]_[SHORT_NAME].md`
4. **Add to STORY_INDEX.md**:
   - Add to appropriate section (Planned Stories)
   - Add to Epic Mapping
   - Include clickable links

### Importing Existing Stories

When converting existing documents to the standard story format:

1. **Determine the next available story number** from STORY_INDEX.md
2. **Create new file** using `STORY_[NUMBER]_[SHORT_NAME].md` format
3. **Convert content** to follow STORY_TEMPLATE.md structure:
   - Update metadata section with story number, name, epic, priority, duration
   - Convert existing sections to match template (Overview, User Story, Background, etc.)
   - Ensure all acceptance criteria are clearly defined
   - Add technical requirements and implementation details
4. **Add to STORY_INDEX.md**:
   - Add entry in appropriate status section (usually Planned Stories)
   - Add to Epic Mapping section with appropriate status icon
   - Include clickable links to the new file
5. **Update README.md** if needed to reference the new standard-format file
6. **Delete the old file** after verifying the conversion is complete

### Story Creation Examples

#### Example: Creating a New Feature Story

```bash
# 1. Check next available number
# Current highest: STORY_015, so next is STORY_016

# 2. Create new file
cp STORY_TEMPLATE.md STORY_016_API_AUTHENTICATION.md

# 3. Edit the file with your requirements
# 4. Add to STORY_INDEX.md in Planned Stories section
# 5. Add to appropriate Epic Mapping
```

#### Example: Importing Existing Document

```bash
# 1. Existing file: PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_STORY.md
# 2. Next number: STORY_016
# 3. Create standard format file
# Copy content and convert to template structure
# 4. Update STORY_INDEX.md
# 5. Update README.md references
# 6. Delete PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_STORY.md
```

### Epic Assignment Guidelines

When creating or importing stories, assign to appropriate epics:

- **Repository Tracking Feature**: Core repo management, Git integration
- **Graph Query Engine**: Query capabilities, Cypher operations, data retrieval
- **Data Management**: CRUD operations, database management, APIs
- **Enterprise Repository Structure**: Multi-project, complex repository support
- **LLM Integration**: AI features, natural language processing
- **Agent Integration**: External tool integration, MCP servers
- **Binary Analysis**: JAR files, bytecode analysis
- **Parser Enhancement**: Java parsing improvements, AST analysis
- **Quality & Testing**: Code quality, testing, security, production readiness

### Story Numbering Best Practices

- **Always check STORY_INDEX.md** for the highest existing number
- **Use sequential numbering** (no gaps or duplicates)
- **Reserve number ranges** for related features if needed
- **Update Epic Mapping** immediately after adding stories

## üìä Status Tracking Best Practices

### Status Definitions

- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Story is fully implemented, tested, and deployed
- **üîÑ IN_PROGRESS**: Story is actively being worked on
- **üìã NOT_STARTED**: Story is planned but work hasn't begun
- **‚è≥ BLOCKED**: Story cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

### Status Update Rules

1. **Always update STORY_INDEX.md first** - this is the source of truth
2. **Be precise with status transitions** - don't skip from NOT_STARTED to COMPLETED
3. **Include progress notes** when updating to IN_PROGRESS
4. **Document blocking reasons** when setting status to BLOCKED

### Validation Checklist

Before marking a story as COMPLETED:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Code is implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] STORY_INDEX.md status is updated
- [ ] Epic Mapping reflects completion
- [ ] Dependent stories are reviewed for unblocking

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Templates

### Story Template Usage

The **[STORY_TEMPLATE.md](./STORY_TEMPLATE.md)** provides:

- **Consistent structure** across all stories
- **Required metadata fields** for tracking
- **Acceptance criteria format** for clear completion goals
- **Technical requirements section** for implementation guidance
- **Risk assessment framework** for planning

### Story Index Features

The **[STORY_INDEX.md](./STORY_INDEX.md)** provides:

- **Clickable navigation** to all story documents
- **Epic-based organization** for logical grouping
- **Status legends** for clear understanding
- **Dependency tracking** between stories
- **Progress visualization** through status icons

## üéØ Best Practices for Teams

### For Developers

1. **Always check STORY_INDEX.md** before starting work
2. **Update statuses promptly** to keep team informed
3. **Use clickable links** for quick navigation
4. **Follow the story template** for consistency
5. **Mark completion properly** following the checklist

### For Project Managers

1. **Use STORY_INDEX.md** as the project dashboard
2. **Track epic progress** through the Epic Mapping section
3. **Monitor dependencies** in the Dependencies section
4. **Review statuses regularly** for accuracy
5. **Plan new stories** using the template system

### For Quality Assurance

1. **Validate completion** against acceptance criteria
2. **Check STORY_INDEX.md** for accurate status
3. **Review story documentation** for completeness
4. **Verify dependency tracking** is up to date

## üìñ Related Documentation

- **[docs/](../docs/)** - Technical documentation, API docs, architecture guides
- **[queries/](../queries/)** - Cypher query examples and documentation
- **[scripts/](../scripts/)** - Development and deployment scripts

## üö® Important Reminders

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always Update STORY_INDEX.md on Task Completion

**When you complete ANY story or task, you MUST:**

1. **Update [STORY_INDEX.md](./STORY_INDEX.md)** status immediately
2. **Move completed stories** to the correct section
3. **Update Epic Mapping** status indicators
4. **Check for unblocked dependencies**

**This ensures:**

- ‚úÖ Project status is always current
- ‚úÖ Team has accurate progress visibility
- ‚úÖ Dependencies are properly tracked
- ‚úÖ No stories are forgotten or lost

### Story Status Accuracy

The STORY_INDEX.md is the **single source of truth** for project status. Keep it accurate and up-to-date by:

- Updating it immediately when status changes
- Double-checking epic mappings match individual story statuses
- Reviewing dependencies when completing stories
- Using consistent status terminology
