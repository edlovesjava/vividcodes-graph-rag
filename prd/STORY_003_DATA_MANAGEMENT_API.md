## Story Information

- **Story Number**: STORY_003
- **Story Name**: Data Management API
- **Epic**: Core Infrastructure
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Estimated Duration**: 3 days
- **Dependencies**: STORY_001_REPOSITORY_TRACKING (COMPLETED), STORY_002_CYPHER_QUERY_ENDPOINT (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: COMPLETED

## Overview

This story implements a comprehensive data management API that provides endpoints for clearing data, retrieving statistics, and performing combined clear-and-ingest operations. It enables users to manage the graph database content efficiently and provides insights into the current data state.

## User Story

**As a** system administrator or developer  
**I want** to manage the graph database data through REST API endpoints  
**So that** I can clear data, view statistics, and perform bulk operations efficiently

## Background

The system needs data management capabilities to support development workflows, testing scenarios, and operational maintenance. Users need to be able to clear data when starting fresh, view statistics to understand the current state, and perform combined operations for efficiency.

Key requirements include:

- Clear all data from the graph database
- Retrieve comprehensive statistics about current data
- Perform combined clear-and-ingest operations
- Provide proper error handling and logging
- Support operational workflows and testing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `DELETE /api/v1/data/clear` endpoint
- [x] Create `GET /api/v1/data/stats` endpoint
- [x] Create `POST /api/v1/data/clear-and-ingest` endpoint
- [x] Implement proper error handling for all endpoints
- [x] Add comprehensive logging for all operations
- [x] Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [x] Provide detailed statistics including node counts, relationship counts, and repository information
- [x] Support atomic clear-and-ingest operations
- [x] Include timestamps in all responses
- [x] Handle database connection errors gracefully
- [x] Provide meaningful error messages
- [x] Support validation of request parameters
- [x] Include operation success/failure status in responses

## Technical Requirements

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Changes

Add data management layer with clear, statistics, and combined operation capabilities.

### New Components

// Statistics queries use existing node and relationship structure
```

### API Changes

```json
{
  "data": {
    "clear": "/api/v1/data/clear",
