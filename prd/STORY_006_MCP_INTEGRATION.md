# STORY_006_MCP_INTEGRATION

## Story Information

- **Story Number**: STORY_006
- **Story Name**: MCP Integration
- **Epic**: Agent Integration
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks
- **Dependencies**: STORY_002_CYPHER_QUERY_ENDPOINT (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: NOT_STARTED

## Overview

This story implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables external agents to dynamically compose and execute Cypher queries against the Neo4j graph database. It provides a standardized interface for agents to access code context and perform intelligent queries without direct database access.

## User Story

**As a** developer building agents that need code context  
**I want** a standardized MCP server to query the graph database  
**So that** my agents can dynamically access code information and provide better assistance

## Background

External agents and tools need access to code context to provide meaningful assistance, but current approaches often require:

- Direct database access (security risk)
- Pre-defined queries (limited flexibility)
- Static context windows (outdated information)
- Custom integration code (maintenance overhead)

An MCP server provides a standardized, secure, and flexible way for agents to:

- Dynamically compose queries based on current needs
- Access code context in real-time
- Perform semantic searches across the codebase
- Retrieve structured data for analysis
- Maintain security through controlled access
