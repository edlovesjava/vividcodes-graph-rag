# STORY_014_TEST_COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENT

## Story Information

- **Story Number**: STORY_014
- **Story Name**: Test Coverage Improvement
- **Epic**: Quality & Testing
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 days
- **Dependencies**: None (Can proceed independently)
- **Status**: NOT_STARTED

## Overview

This story improves test coverage to achieve production-ready quality standards. Current test coverage analysis reveals significant gaps in critical areas of the application, with only 26% instruction coverage. Essential services like GraphService, Neo4jHealthService, and API controllers have 0% coverage, posing risks for production deployment and maintenance.

## User Story

**As a** development team maintaining production code  
**I want** comprehensive test coverage across critical system components  
**So that** we can deploy safely, detect regressions early, and maintain high code quality standards

## Background

Current test coverage analysis shows:

- **Overall Coverage**: 26% instruction coverage
- **Total Classes**: 15 classes, only 5 with coverage
- **Critical Gaps**: Core services and API layer completely untested
- **Well Covered**: JavaParserService (89%) and related parsing logic

While core parsing logic has good coverage, essential services that handle graph operations, health monitoring, and API interactions are completely untested. This creates significant risk for production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GraphServiceImpl achieves 90%+ coverage with comprehensive business logic testing
- [ ] Neo4jHealthService achieves 95%+ coverage with connectivity and error scenarios
- [ ] IngestionController achieves 85%+ coverage with API endpoint testing
- [ ] PackageNode and FieldNode models achieve 75%+ coverage
- [ ] CodeContext and IngestionRequest DTOs achieve 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Overall system instruction coverage reaches 80%+
- [ ] Integration tests cover end-to-end workflows
- [ ] All critical error scenarios are tested
- [ ] Test execution time remains under 30 seconds for unit tests
- [ ] Coverage reports are generated automatically
- [ ] Tests integrate with CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for all service classes with business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] API endpoint testing with request/response validation
- [ ] Error scenario testing for database failures

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Test execution performance under 30 seconds (unit tests)

- [ ] No flaky tests - consistent pass rates
- [ ] Meaningful assertions beyond just execution
- [ ] Proper mocking strategy for external dependencies

void shouldReturnHealthStatus_WhenDatabaseIsAccessible()
```

        when(neo4jDriver.session()).thenReturn(session);

        // When
        String result = graphService.savePackage(packageNode);
